# Number-Strategy

A small console game based on numbers

## Rules:

* Each player gets a set of numbers (currently for the player it is: 3, 5, 7 and for the computer it's: 4, 6, 8)
* Each player puts at every turn a number from their set on the table (the command is of the form: number column line)
* The winner is the one who makes the sum on either a column or a line to be a certain value (currently 21)
* If a player places a number such that the sum on either a column or a line is bigger than the target value, they lose


## TODO:

Add the ability to choose different options for the game
